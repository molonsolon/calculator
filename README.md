# Dream Calculator
Do you remember your dreams? If so, are you able to make sense of them? Maybe we can help...

This app provides gentle music while you do your calculations. There's another layer to explore, but it may not be easy to access. Listen to your intuition and your answers will be revealed. After all, everything we need is already a part of us. 

If you're able to access the game, you will not be able to do much other than introduce yourself. For now, this layer serves as a preview. 

## Reflection ##
This was an assignment from The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript curriculum that snowballed into the beginning of a passion project. When I finished the basic functionality of the calculator, I wanted to make it look unique and include interactive elements to make it a worthwhile stop in one's internet travels. My fascination with mysterious website led me to take it one step further and include a hidden page within the application. At the time I had already been experimenting with 3D modeling and animation in blender so I decided to take these skills with me on my developing journey. I wanted to capture the same feelings I had when I would visit a website with secret areas as a kid so I made the entrance to the game a vague riddle. As I stated above, the game as it stands is simply a visual and functional preview of a larger story that I'm currently writing. The game is comprised of a  series of questions that will lead you down different paths depending on your answers. The intention is to make the player question their choices and the lives they lead in ways that they might have not before. 

## Skills Learned ##
* How to display audio and video using HTML and JS
* How to listen for keyboard inputs and map accordingly
* How to add transitions and animations using CSS
* How to route to different HTML pages. 

# IMPORTANT NOTE
If you're having trouble solving the riddle, think telephone codes. What are you trying to investigate? How would that be written using those telephone-letter associations?
