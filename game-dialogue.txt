Do you know why you're here?

    if yes -- That is good. This is no place for fear. There is a door which you may leave through whenver you wish.
    if no -- Pay attention. Experience is constant and memories fade with each passing moment. There is a door which you may leave through whenver you wish, but I reccomend you stay awhile.

    1. I do not want to continue 
    2. I have found love amongst imperfection
    3. I seek the salvation of my soul.
    4. There is much more to accomplish.
